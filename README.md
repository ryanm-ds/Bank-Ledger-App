# Bank-Ledger-App
A simple app that acts like a bank ledger where users can either create or login to their bank account. The user's account page displays their current balance, last 5 transactions, and visualizes their activity. Data is hosted on a remote MongoDB database, where all bank transactons are stored and retrieved. The app is built on the Python flask library.

This project was mostly inspired by this tutorial, where a good part of the code comes from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1STSSumoVk . I made this bank ledger app by adding features to the code from the tutorial.
